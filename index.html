    <h2 id="about">About</h2> 
    <p class="notopmargin"> 
    The LITMUS<sup>RT</sup> patch is <strong>a (soft) real-time extension of the Linux
    kernel</strong> with a focus on multiprocessor real-time scheduling and
    synchronization. The Linux kernel is modified 
    to support the sporadic task
    model and modular scheduler plugins. Clustered, partitioned, and global scheduling
    are included, and semi-partitioned scheduling is supported as well.
    </p>
    <h2>Goals</h2> 
    <p class="notopmargin"> 
    The primary purpose of the LITMUS<sup>RT</sup> project is to <strong>provide  a useful experimental platform for applied real-time systems research</strong>. To that end, LITMUS<sup>RT</sup> provides abstractions and interfaces within the kernel that simplify the prototyping of multiprocessor real-time scheduling and synchronization algorithms (compared to modifying a "vanilla" Linux kernel).
    </p>
    <p>As a secondary goal, LITMUS<sup>RT</sup> serves as a <strong>proof of concept</strong>, showing how algorithms such as Pfair schedulers can be implemented on current hardware. Finally, we hope that parts of LITMUS<sup>RT</sup> and the "lessons learned" may find value as blueprints/sources of inspiration for other  implementation efforts (both commercial and open source).
    </p> 
    <h2>Non-Goals</h2> 
    <p class="notopmargin"> 
    LITMUS<sup>RT</sup> is a research prototype that is reasonably stable and tested, but there are currently no plans to turn it into a production-quality system. Furthermore, LITMUS<sup>RT</sup>'s API is not "stable," that is, interfaces and implementations may change without warning between releases. POSIX-compliance is not a goal; the LITMUS<sup>RT</sup>-API offers alternate system call interfaces. While we aim to follow Linux-coding standards, LITMUS<sup>RT</sup> is not targeted at being merged into mainline Linux. Rather, we hope that some of the ideas protoyped in LITMUS<sup>RT</sup> may eventually find adoption in Linux or other kernels.
    </p> 
    <h2>Current Version</h2> 
    <p class="notopmargin"> 
The current version of LITMUS<sup>RT</sup> is <strong>2012.2</strong> and is based on Linux&nbsp;3.0. 
    It was released on 08/01/2012 and includes plugins for the following
    scheduling policies:    </p> 
    <ul> 
      <li> Partitioned EDF with synchronization support (PSN-EDF),</li> 
      <li> Global EDF with synchronization support (GSN-EDF),</li> 
      <li> Clustered EDF (C-EDF),</li>
      <li> Partitioned Fixed-Priority (P-FP), and </li> 
      <li> PD<sup>2</sup>, with either staggered or aligned quanta (PFAIR).</li> 
    </ul>
