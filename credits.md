## Citations

The LITMUS^RT project is an open source project based on
Linux. It was initially launched in 2006 at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC).
It is maintained primarily by [Björn Brandenburg](http://www.mpi-sws.org/~bbb) with some help from
the real-time groups at <a
href="http://http://rts.mpi-sws.org">MPI-SWS</a> and <a
href="http://www.cs.unc.edu/rt">UNC</a>.


When referencing LITMUS^RT, please cite two publications:

1. The **original** LITMUS^RT paper: J. Calandrino, H. Leontyev, A. Block, U. Devi, and J. Anderson, "LITMUS^RT: A Testbed for Empirically Comparing Real-Time Multiprocessor Schedulers", Proceedings of the 27th IEEE Real-Time Systems Symposium, pp. 111-123, December 2006.

2. The **description of the current version**: B. Brandenburg, "Scheduling and Locking in Multiprocessor Real-Time Operating Systems", PhD thesis, UNC Chapel Hill, 2011.

While [1] is the first publication on LITMUS^RT, the first public release of LITMUS^RT was actually based on a reimplementation in 2007. All versions since 2007 are best described by the detailed description in [2].
